# 🧑‍🎤 Celebrity Detection using Deep Learning

A deep learning system to detect and recognize celebrities in images using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning.

## 🎯 Objective
Build an AI system that can:
- Detect faces in images
- Classify the detected faces as known celebrities
- Be fine-tuned and extended to various public figure datasets

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- OpenCV / Dlib for face detection
- Google Colab + Drive integration
- Transfer learning (e.g., VGGFace, ResNet, FaceNet)
